    <p>'Andersson Bell, Korean streetwear meets Scandinavian aesthetics' 
    </p>

    <p>Launched in Seoul the year of 2014, the brand “Andersson Bell” began from a Creative Director,
who got an inspiration from contrasting two different cultures of Korea and Scandinavian.
Andersson Bell was launched by reinterpreting Scandinavian vibes to create new objects from a point of Korean’s view.</p>

<h1>The Brand</h1>
</div>
<p>Culture, colour and contrast fuse in pieces that riff on classic silhouettes with a twist - think asymmetrical dresses, reversible coats and denim-trimmed leather jackets. </p>

<p>The brand’s first word “Andersson” is from a typical Swedish last name and the second word “Bell” represents a traditional Korean temple bell.
Simply the two contrasting cultural traits combined as one and became Andersson Bell.</p>
<p>Inspired by the minimalistic foundations of Scandinavian fashion Andersson Bell creates story-telling looks that make Korean street-wear embrace Nordic aesthetics. The brand approaches opposites to integrate them both into the pieces, past and present, traditional and modern and the mix results in timeless casual silhouettes with an avant-garde spin.</p>

<h1>10th anniversary</h1>
</div>
<p>Andersson Bell debuts at Milan Fashion Week and celebrates its tenth anniversary.
</p>
<p>Finally, after ten years in the industry, the Seoul-based brand Andersson Bell – born out of a desire to combine contrasting cultural elements through clothing – has landed in one of the fashion capitals par excellence, Milan, and its respective fashion week, which served as the setting for its debut show and the celebration of its tenth anniversary.</p>
<p>Andersson Bell’s Spring/Summer 24 is titled “The 10th Anniversary” and was inspired by the designer’s teenage years in the city where he founded the brand. Kim decided to go back to those days when he strolled through the city’s vintage district and was fascinated by military surplus and denim, both of which have had a notable presence in the collection, along with the biker/racing aesthetic.</p>
